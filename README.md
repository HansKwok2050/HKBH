## Project Aims
This project is to develop a cross-platform natural science survey system about birds in Hong Kong. The project aims to help surveyors keep records conveniently and reliably and to inspire a love of nature in the general public by providing channels for public participation.
## Project Objectives
- To conveniently enable surveyors to record and submit survey information using digital devices, including computers, tablets and mobile phones.
- To allow researchers to find the species they need using the search function.
- To provide an easy-to-use interface for moderators to approve survey information submissions.
## Project Vision
Hong Kong Bird Hub (HKBH) is a cross-platform online system which provides instant access to a database of bird observations. Whether you are a scientist, researcher or amateur naturalist, HKBH is a user-friendly application to keep records of species conveniently, safely and securely. It is also fun for the general public to use HKBH to share their bird observations while a love-to-nature message is inspired as everybody participates. Unlike other applications, all information submitted to HKBH is approved before being published to the general public.
